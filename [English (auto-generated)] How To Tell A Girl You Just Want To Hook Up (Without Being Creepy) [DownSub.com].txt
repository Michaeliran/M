how do you let a girl know that you're

just interested in a hookup the big

thing guys is not to lie about this not

to pretend like you're looking for

something more you could say very

lightly i'm not looking for anything

serious i'm just looking to have a good

time with good people you know i'm just

looking for a girl that i can have a

little bit of fun with and enjoy each

other's company that right there if a

girl hears that she knows what you're

looking for she knows what that means

you don't have to be very direct about

it it's a subtle way to indicate it

anything like that where you're making

it very clear that you're not looking

for anything long term and you're not

having to lie about it if you just tell

a girl i'm just looking first

looking for a hookup she's going to feel

cheap she's going to feel dirty but if

you say something like you know i'm just

looking for someone cool to hang out

with and have a good time and have some

fun nothing serious then she feels a

little bit more okay about that if

that's what she's interested in as well

and you don't make it awkward and weird
